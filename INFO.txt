Put inside a theme you want to swap the colors of.

Prepare with comb.png (THE ONES WITH THE COLOR EDIT) This should be the top and bottom image together
Prepare with old_comb.png, bottom_old.png (THE ORIGINAL) Make sure they are identical, except for the color diffrence and naming

Prepare with colors.meta and colors_old.meta respectively.

Also set the size within the script (Should just be 512)

Run the program and wait for it to finish

You should have a colors_new.meta.
Make sure it's all correct and setup the newly edited theme :)
